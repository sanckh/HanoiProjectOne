About this game: 
1. You are able to enter as many disks as you'd like up to 40. 
2. The game is initialized with five towers at the start.
3. The disks have an additional restriction of only being able to move one peg at a time. I thought that would be fun. 
4. I added two tests. One to print the current time, so no errors are thrown when run. And another to make sure the user enters more than "0" for number of disks.
5. I was unable to figure out how to change the number of towers with the recursion mathematics. I have the code to ask the user to enter the number of towers,
but unfortunately it doesn't do anything to the program itself. So the game will always use five towers regardless. 
6. Some of the things I tried: 
   - using Stack to change the number of towers programmatically. 
   - using an array of towers and manually entering up to ten towers. This is a semi-working solution but it would force me to write the recursion for every single tower input the 
   user asks for. I thought that would be an extremely poor way to write this and it forced the program to run into several errors as I tried to work through it. 

With that being said, I hope the code I sent does a well enough job to show my working knowledge of programming. I am extremely excited to learn, and have been studying the Tower
of Hanoi for two days extremely late into the night. I am a sponge and constantly eager to learn as much as I possibly can.
